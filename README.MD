# Blockchain Education Network Hackathon Guide

## The Basics
Major League Hacking, the student hackathon league, has an Organizer guide which covers many of the fundamentals you'll need to understand for hosting a university level hackathon. View their guide at [https://guide.mlh.io/](https://guide.mlh.io/). After reading that guide, take a look at Nirag Pant's list of [hackathon resources](https://github.com/xasos/Hackathon-Resources).
